Using Deezer API: https://developers.deezer.com/api (Authentication is required to check the api documentation), implement an application using React and Redux to show a list of music genres. This api is your starting point (https://api.deezer.com/genre).

·         Music genres should be listed in a card or list item with its image and name .

·         Upon clicking on any genre item or a "show artists" button, a list of related artists should be displayed in a new page or a popup modal (modal is a bonus ). Hint: the URL should be `/:id` if the modal is open.

·         Using any 3rd party is allowed but a rectified version of it, "antd or semantic ui are recommended).

·         Using Redux is a must.

Extra bonus points:

·         Styling with styled-components.

·         User Authentication.

·         Write a unit tests for the written components.
